Feature: Anagram Checker - True Anagram Pairs
  As a user
  I want to check if two strings are anagrams
  So that I can verify their relationship

  Scenario Outline: Verify strings that ARE anagrams return true
    Given the input strings "<input1>" and "<input2>"
    When I check if they are anagrams
    Then the result should be "<output>"

    Examples:
      | input1          | input2          | output |
      | listen          | silent          | true   |
      | conversation    | voices rant on  | true   |
      | school master   | the classroom   | true   |
      | a gentleman     | elegant man     | true   |
      | eleven plus two | twelve plus one | true   |
      | apple           | paple           | true   |
